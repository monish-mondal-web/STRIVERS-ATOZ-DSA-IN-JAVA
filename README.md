# 🚀 Striver's AtoZ DSA in Java

Welcome to my comprehensive **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice repository based on **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**, implemented in **Java**.  
This repository is part of my 4-month dedicated roadmap to crack top tech company interviews.

## 🧠 Why Java?

Java is widely used in technical interviews for its object-oriented design, extensive libraries, and platform independence.  
Practicing DSA in Java helps develop deep problem-solving logic with clean code structure.
